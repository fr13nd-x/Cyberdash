## Cyberdash CVE Data Visualization Project Documentation

Welcome to the CVE Data Visualization React Project Documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance on setting up, running, and understanding the project.

### Getting Started
To begin working with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/fr13nd-x/Cyberdash.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    $ cd Cyberdash
    ```
3. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

### Running the Project
Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies, you can run the React project using the following command:
```bash
$ npm start
```
This command starts the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### About the Project
The CVE Data Visualization React Project is the author's first React project. It serves as a tool to visualize and help users understand 500 records of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data from a JSON file. (downloaded from cve.org)

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

### Conclusion
The CVE Data Visualization React Project provides a valuable learning experience in building React applications and visualizing complex data sets. It offers users insights into cybersecurity vulnerabilities and demonstrates best practices in React development.
